Keiko Tsuda were one of the many players in the vibrant collective of French electronic math, which also includes bands like Geste, Jean Jean, Quadrupede, and Chevreuil. Perhaps what made albums like Sake Duo Kit stand out from the others was its eccentric punk aesthetic. The seven tracks on this debut incorporate looping and improvisation, are punchy, quirky, and have a rascally manner to them.
