  designation : "Keiko Tsuda / 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8"
  content : "Keiko Tsuda were one of the many players in the vibrant collective of French electronic math, which also includes bands like Geste, Jean Jean, Quadrupede, and Chevreuil. Perhaps what made albums like Sake Duo Kit stand out from the others was its eccentric punk aesthetic. The seven tracks on this debut incorporate looping and improvisation, are punchy, quirky, and have a rascally manner to them."

  designation : "tempus fugit / Altered Guitar Beats"
  content : "tempus fugit is the ritual music for a post-apocalyptic society which has descended into savagery in the bombed-out streets of new york. you're probably asking, if the music is this harsh, why should i care? tempus fugit is worth listening to for the same reason that we give such attention to classical music -- the thought and skill that goes into piecing these individual elements into a cohesive whole is he music was too complex for many, yet today it is impossible to discuss the high points of culture without invoking these same compositions"

  designation : "objet / in c"
  content : "A very interesting and worthwhile solo live performance of In C done with loopers. Any performance of the piece where the fragments are looped loses some of the excitement of an ensemble performance, but for one person to do this in one take is remarkable. It works. "
