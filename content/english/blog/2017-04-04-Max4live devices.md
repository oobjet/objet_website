## Ring Delay

Ring Delay is a max4live device that offers an unorthodox mix of delay and ring modulator to achieve new sonic capabilities in a very simple setup.

It is a ring modulator that uses input signal and a delayed version of this input signal as inputs. It's a delay with a few new tricks :

- if the sound stops, the delay stops immediately which means everything stays in sync even for odd delay time
- nice robotics sub frequencies appear that fatten your sound
- it's very efficient at mashup rhythm 

This video shows a few examples of how to use it and how it sounds.
