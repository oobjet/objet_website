In my recurring obsession to play Terry Riley's In C, I made a first attempt with [a guitar and six amplifiers]({{< ref "2016-02-19-in c.md" >}} ""). Being an algorithmic composition (53 patterns of various lengths), I thought of Tidal Cycles as a perfect platform for another attempt to render this iconic piece.

I wrote the code and recorded myself "playing" it with the "show us your screen" mantra of live coders.
