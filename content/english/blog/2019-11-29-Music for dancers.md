# release notes

> The living need light, the dead need music

During more than 15 years, I composed and recorded music that is both cinematographic and dance related.
I was connected to contemporary music during my stay in Lyon where I regularly went out to _la maison de la danse_. If I was usually happy of what I had seen, it was the music which stayed in my head for the rest of the night. And how the music and sound aggregate with the bodies on stage.
I was fascinated and I always tried to incorporate that feeling to movement and dance to the pieces I wrote.

The four pieces of « music for dancers » grab element of rhythmic stability/instability and melodic elements.

_Africa_ is my own vision of west african music and rhythm.
_Max and steve_ is a piece combining polyrhythm in a live-looping situation (guitar + synth).
_Music box_ brings acoustics instruments sonority and acoustic drums in an ever-evolving canevas.
_Prayer for Europe_ is a guitar sample reworked in a 3D sound table with multiple outputs.
