In June 2021, after a long period of lockdown, I began writing a novel with the goal of publishing one chapter per month for a year. The novel is built around two characters who each seem to be fighting for a liberation that obsesses them. It was imagined with a soundtrack that includes pieces already published and others recorded for the occasion. It can be read while bathing in this same music which seeks to place the reader in this universe not
defined neither temporally, nor geographically. Just as the writing creates an imaginary world tinged with realism, the pieces that cross it are to be heard as a folklore to be invented.
