I’ve just finished my first [arduinome](http://flipmu.com/work/arduinome/). It’s a clone of the [monome](http://monome.org/) based on [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/). I’m a long time fanatic of this little 8×8 grid buttons box. Minimalism at its edge. The community behind this is wonderful. It’s much more than a midi interface, it a new and (to me at least) logical way to ‘touch’ music and sound in general. It’s eating my nights and give fresh meat to chew to my brain just like the electric guitar did 25 years ago (just another 6×12 matrix by the way).

*‘An instrument must be specific and limited in what it does, to be generic and limitless in what it can do.’*
