I've just released the first iteration of my new live-looper called **tsunami**.
After [**Tahiti Looper**](https://oooooooooo.net/2018/02/08/tahiti-looper-explained/) which focuses on polyrythm and polymetrics, **tsunami** is a platform for manipulating loops in a live or studio situation. It mixes functions from the venerable **Echoplex Digital Pro** and **MLR** app from the monome community.
It's an attempt to make complex loop from simple materials easily and in real-time.
You can learn more about it on [**tsunami** GitHub repository](https://github.com/oobjet/tsunami).

Here's a [quick demo video](https://youtu.be/kTpTTowCp-4) of **tsunami** in action :
