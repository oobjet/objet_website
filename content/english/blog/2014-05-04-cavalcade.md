It was during a cold december night. My old trusty MS-20 was looking at me from its dark case. Feeling vaguely guilty, I powered it up, plugged a few cable and added my looping rig output in the *External signal Processor*. And then, from its old circuitry, the beautiful analog beast added its voice to my mashed up guitar sound. Five hours later, I had a few nice improvised tunes that I decided to release one day. That day has come.
