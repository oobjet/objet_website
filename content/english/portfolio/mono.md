Mono is my first album under the name of objet.
I could have released it as a *tempus fugit* album but I was tired of a certain way of making music at the time and wanted to break away from it. Does changing the name change the music? Certainly not, but I realized that I felt freer without the long and dense *tempus fugit* discography and the teenage life that went with it.

Iâ€™ve been working a whole year on this new release. It was a lot of fun (re-)discovering old and new technology, playing drums, pushing keys and buttons, hiding some of my favorite musicians into my own creation.
