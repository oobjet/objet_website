Lyon Loop Jubilee 2014 was a fantastic evening. 

Here's a short extract of my live performance :

Â 

For those asking "WTF!!?", it's only guitar live recorded with "Echoloop" ([VST looper](http://www.mathons.com/)) and mashed with a modified MAX/MSP patch based on MLR (Created by [Brian Crabtree](http://nnnnnnnn.org/)).

Apart from this, I love to play and sing folk music...

If you want to listen to more glitchy guitar live looping, please download my new solo album entirely recorded with the same setup.
