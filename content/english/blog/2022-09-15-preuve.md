Preuve (proof in french) is a collection of guitar pieces recorded over a period of twenty years. Never released before, they are a testimony of contemporary composition and improvisation on electric and acoustic guitars. Sometimes used as a full orchestra or in a much more intimate way, the instrument takes on various forms, yet composing a perfectly coherent whole.
