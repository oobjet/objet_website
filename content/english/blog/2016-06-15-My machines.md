The day I decided to remove my own taste from my music, I built theses machines. I admit I like to build impossibly complex machine that generates music. Truly, I am furiously working on that (the thing is I had plenty of time since I like create and listen to weird music, which isn't socially compatible). I have completely stopped buying musical gear to concentrate only on programming. The seed was planted with my frustration with live loopers. I built dozens of them in Max Msp . 

Preprogrammed live looping is part of the deal in theses tracks but most of it is made by a crazy AI being a ghost of me during one night.
